# Elements of Statistical Machine Learning

## Course Description
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) for the assignments of the Elements of Statistical Machine Learning course. The course focused on the statistical foundations underlying simple machine learning models, including Bayesian inference, linear regression, Gaussian models and processes, and Monte Carlo methods.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by lab sessions. Each Jupyter Notebook file corresponds to a specific lab session held during the course. Each file contains the implementation of algorithms and solutions to the problems given during that lab.
